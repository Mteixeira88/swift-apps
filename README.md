This repo is for some SWIFT tutorials I'm following from [Udemy iOS 12 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios12/).

All swift files have comments explaning what it's doing and why to do like that.

## Begginer file
File with the basic of switch such as variable types, conditionals, loops, etc...

## Swoosh app
App that have multiple screens and goes and passes data from one to another by clicking a button using Auto Layout, UI Stack views and passing data between view controllers.

## Dev-Profile app
App that uses the contraints options (Regular and Compact) to position the correct layout for iPhone and iPad without any code and only using Auto Layout.

## Window-Shopper app
App that calculates how many hours we need to work to buy somehting by creating a button programatically and using drawRect on TextField VIEW.

This app also has a very simple unit testing that verifies if the MODEL is working well.

## Coder-Swag app
App that replicates an online store without any server conection (uses only local data).

Uses TableViews, ContentView and Protocols for both.

Uses MVC design pattern


## XYZ app
Simple app that shows how to use the Apple's acclerometer library.


## Smack app
App that replicates "Slack" with a chat room where you can create users and rooms, send and receive messages through a socket, login and logout users.

This app uses CocoaPods, for those who familiar with NPM packages, this is the xCode NPM, basically it's packages coded by anyone and they have rates and you can install them in you project by downloading thei [app](https://cocoapods.org/app).
